title: "How many countries in the world?",
content: "249 Country Codes in the ISO Standard List
Ever been filling out an internet form, and had to choose from a surprisingly long list of countries? You were probably looking at the international standard 'country code' list, technically known by the exciting name of ISO 3166-1. Lots of companies and other organizations adopt this standard list instead of spending their own time compiling one. The standard also includes convenient two-letter codes for each country, like us for the United States, de for Germany, and jp for Japan, which you might recognize from website addresses specific to those countries.

This ISO standard is based on an official list kept by the UN...but then why on Earth are there 249 country codes? That's way more than the total number of UN member and observer countries! Well, the standard list does leave out some breakaway states that aren't recognized by the UN, but then makes up for it by listing dependent territories separately from their parent countries. In other words, the ISO list is more an answer to the question, 'How many countries and territories in the world?' than 'How many countries in the world?'

That means there are 'country codes' not just for actual countries, but also for nearly-independent states, overseas colonies, uninhabited islands, and even Antarctica! That's important because organizations might need an option for any place that any person can live, and dependent territories often aren't technically part of the countries they belong to.

UN Members: 193
UN Observer States: 2
States With Partial Recognition: 2 
Inhabited Dependent Territories: 45
Uninhabited Territories: 6
Antarctica: 1
Total: 249

So there you have it! Next time someone tells you 'There are 194 countries in the world,' remember that the real answer isn't so simple!",

title: "List of countries and dependencies by population",
content: "This is a list of countries and dependencies by population. It includes sovereign states, inhabited dependent territories and, in some cases, constituent countries of sovereign states, with inclusion within the list being primarily based on the ISO standard ISO 3166-1. For instance, the United Kingdom is considered as a single entity, while the constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands are considered separately. In addition, this list includes certain states with limited recognition not found in ISO 3166-1. Also given in percent is each country's population compared with the world population, which the United Nations estimates at 7.86 billion as of today.",
